# Project Anhedonia
An attempt at making a game in Odin Lang.

Mostly off the cuff, updating with ideas as they come to me.

## To Do (In order of priority): 
  - Flesh out interaction system (In Progress)
  - ~~Add UI text capabilites~~
  - Decide a font
  - Flesh out Non-playable movement system
  - Create Game State Manager
  - Create item system
  - Add system for loading data from JSONs (Non-playables and maps)
  - Flesh out story and world
  - Draft up UI
  - Draft up battle system
  - Create more sprites
  - Add animation
